                        The Big Bang Theory is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both
                        of
                        whom
                        served as executive producers on the series, along with Steven Molaro. The three of them also
                        served
                        as
                        head writers. It aired on CBS on September 24, 2007 to May 16, 2019, running for 12 seasons and
                        279
                        episodes.

                        The story of The Big Bang Theory takes place in Pasadena, almost entirely confined to a few
                        apartments. It centers around the misadventures of physicists Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon
                        Cooper,
                        branching out from these co-workers and roommates to include their fellow Caltech scientists,
                        neighbors in their building and romantic partners. Cooper is a theoretical genius who has
                        trouble
                        grounding himself in the real world. At the beginning of the series, he holds an incredibly
                        condescending view of non-scientists and believes himself to be an unparalleled intellect.

                        Hofstader has a much kinder view of the world. However, both of them have trouble interacting
                        with
                        neurotypical people, particularly women. Throughout the series, partners and friends bring
                        Hofstader, Cooper and their friends astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali and engineer Howard Wolowitz
                        out
                        of their respective shells. The catalyst for this introduction to the outside world is Penny,
                        the
                        boys' neighbor who lives across the hall in their apartment building. The aspiring actress and
                        waitress makes friends easily, and her proximity to the scientists helps to drag them out of
                        their
                        cloistered and academic existence.

                            physicist. Next to his best friend Leonard Hofstadter, heâ€™s the main protagonist of The Big
                            Bang Theory. Originally from East Texas, Sheldon started college at the age of 11, receiving
                            his first Ph.D. at the age of 16. As a kid, Sheldon was involved in numerous experiments as
                            a "wunderkind," such as his plan to provide free electricity for his hometown by building a
                            nuclear reactor - a plan that government pen-pushers stopped, claiming that it is illegal to
                            store yellowcake uranium in a garden shed.

                            Penny Hofstadter is the primary female character in the series. She
                            lives in Apartment 4A with her husband Leonard Hofstadter across the hall from Sheldon
                            Cooper and Amy Farrah Fowler who live in apartment 4B where Penny used to live. Her full
                            first name is possibly "Penelope" as implied by "The Barbarian Sublimation", as her username
                            was "Queen Penelope." She was unknowingly married to her ex-boyfriend Zack Johnson for three
                            years, so her name could include "Johnson." That marriage was finally annulled in "The
                            Thanksgiving Decoupling".
