                <p>
                    The Big Bang Theory is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both of
                    whom
                    served as executive producers on the series, along with Steven Molaro. The three of them also served
                    as
                    head writers. It aired on CBS on September 24, 2007 to May 16, 2019, running for 12 seasons and 279
                    episodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The show originally centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: Leonard Hofstadter
                    (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons), both physicists at Caltech, who share an
                    apartment;
                    Penny (Kaley Cuoco), a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and
                    Sheldon's similarly geeky and socially awkward friends and coworkers, aerospace engineer Howard
                    Wolowitz
                    (Simon Helberg) and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar). Over time, supporting
                    characters were promoted to starring roles, including neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim
                    Bialik),
                    microbiologist Bernadette Rostenkowski (Melissa Rauch), and comic book store owner Stuart Bloom
                    (Kevin
                    Sussman).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The show was filmed in front of a live audience and produced by Chuck Lorre Productions and Warner
                    Bros.
                    Television. It received mixed reviews throughout its first season, but reception was more favorable
                    in
                    the second and third seasons. Despite early mixed reviews, seven seasons were ranked within the top
                    ten
                    of the final season ratings, and it ultimately reached the no. 1 spot in its eleventh season. It was
                    nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series from 2011 to 2014 and won the Emmy Award
                    for
                    Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series four times for Parsons. In total, it won seven Emmy Awards
                    from 46 nominations. Parsons also won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Television Comedy Series
                    in
                    2011. In 2017, the series spawned a prequel series, Young Sheldon, based on Parsons' character
                    Sheldon
                    Cooper; it also airs on CBS.
